# clinton_clock
This is a countup clock since the last Hillary Clinton press conference. 

I'm using HTML 5-BP for the basic setup. This is just a fun exercise for me to work with Javascript and do a little programming.

You can find it online at <a href="http://grumblemore.com" target="_blank">Grumblmore.com</a>

If you look at the main.js vs. the clock.js files you can see the changes I made to the algorithm. 
I think I've got it right this time.

I've since added another page with a button that provides a download of Donald Trump's latest taxes... Just kidding. The buttom is animated using jquery and javascipt to change the css properities. It's just a fun exercise to help me continue to learn web development.
